The principle of the puzzle is described, as well as its complexity. The approaches include **backtracking**, **simulated annealing**, **genetic algorithms** and use of external **SAT solvers**. Each of them is presented at first in a general way, then in the Eternity II's matter. **All** algorithms are **implemented** and their efficiency has been measured and logged. The results are compared at the end. The thesis also involves a description of a written **Simplify** and **Dimacs CNF** formats convertor which can be used for solving any problem by certain SAT solvers.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Files\r\n\r\n[Thesis](https://garncarz.github.io/eternity/bakalarka.pdf) (only in Czech)\r\n\r\n[Presentation](https://garncarz.github.io/eternity/prezentace.pdf) (only in Czech)\r\n",
