<p>The thesis is concerned with an attempt to find different approaches to solve the Eternity II puzzle. The principle of the puzzle is described, as well as its complexity. The approaches include <strong>backtracking</strong>, <strong>simulated annealing</strong>, <strong>genetic algorithms</strong> and use of external <strong>SAT solvers</strong>. Each of them is presented at first in a general way, then in the Eternity II's matter. <strong>All</strong> algorithms are <strong>implemented</strong> and their efficiency has been measured and logged. The results are compared at the end. The thesis also involves a description of a written <strong>Simplify</strong> and <strong>Dimacs CNF</strong> formats convertor which can be used for solving any problem by certain SAT solvers.</p>
